/**
 *  The layout of a packet looks like this:
 *
 *  ETX LEN DATA ... CRC STX
 *
 *  Currently, there is no ACK/NAK to the protocol as it is assumed that the
 *  the data is trvelling over a directly connected serial line.
 *
 *  In the event that this is done in the future, then intent is to use
 *  the top two bits of the length as a sequence number and use reserved
 *  values of the packet length to indicate ACK/NAK/SYN.
 *
 *  The CRC is calculated using CRC-8 (same as with the PEC in SMBus).
 *
 *  This protocol has two "modes", text mode and packet mode. When in text
 *  mode, any characters which are received are passed on directly, which
 *  allows the underlying microprocessor to employ simple logging.
